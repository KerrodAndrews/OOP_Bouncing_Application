![bounce app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1630880a-9379-4d3c-af26-b19ebc6562bb)

## Description

This is a Java Application that allows the user to create and remove objects in an environment. The user can create a Rectangle, a Square or a nested shape. A nested shape allows the user to add any of the previously mentioned shapes inside of the nested shape. You can also remove the shapes from inside the nested shape. The shapes bounce around forever in the enviroment and bounce off walls. You can also choose what bounce mode you want the shape to have when you create it. Either bouncing or staggering.

**Running the application**

You can easily run the application by downloading the A3.java file and opening it on any enviroment of your choice. I used VS code for this project.
